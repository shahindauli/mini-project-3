                        theirs who can say only wonderfull things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff didn't disappoint.
                        They were very hands on and I never wait long for assissttance. The agile team project, in particular, was
                        oouutstanding. It took my leaarning to the next level in a way that  no tutorial could never have.  In  fact
                        , I'vve often refferd to it during interview  as example  of my development experience. It certainly help
